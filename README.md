# reproflop
Long accumulator implementation as a C++ class with example usages in existing parallel programs. This implementations guarantees reproducible and accurate floating-point computation for 32-bit floating-point numbers (float).

Project documentation available only in Serbian in the docs\ folder (to be added once completed). The project was a part of my master's thesis at the University of Belgrade, School of Electrical Engineering.
